# Objective

A website where musicians get chord progressions based on their current mood — meeting them at the moment of creative itch, the "I want to play something right now" feeling.

# Target customer

Musicians across all skill levels, from beginners to experts. The common thread isn't skill — it's the moment: feeling creative, feeling something, and wanting to turn that into music.

# Success

This is an MVP. Success = getting it in front of musicians and seeing how they react. Do they engage? Do they come back? Does it spark something?

# What I believe

- Art is driven by emotions. Emotions are the key to creating art.
- Most music tools organize by key, genre, or difficulty — but music doesn't start from theory outward, it starts from feeling outward. The creative tool should do the same.
- Mood is the right door to walk musicians through. It aligns the tool with how music actually gets made.
- Musicians are underserved by a "full experience" that thrives their creativity and empowers their muse.

# What I need to research

- Which moods map well to chord progressions, and how to curate that mapping accurately
- What instruments to support at launch
- Competitive landscape — what exists today and where it falls short
- Whether the mood-to-progression mapping feels "right" to real musicians

# Solution directions

**Core flow:** mood → instrument → chord progressions sorted by complexity → scale & theory context when a progression is selected

**Additional features:**
- Audio preview — hear the progression played on your chosen instrument before committing (the "whoa" moment)
- Save / favorites — build a personal library of progressions you've vibed with
- "Surprise me" / shuffle — for when the mood is "I don't know, just give me something"

# Risks to validate + how to validate them cheaply/quickly

| Risk | Cheap validation |
|------|-----------------|
| Musicians don't actually want mood as the entry point | Interview 10-15 musicians, show them the flow mockup, see if it clicks |
| Mood-to-chord mapping feels generic or "off" | Have musically trained people review the mappings before building |
| Users try it once but don't return | Track repeat visits in the MVP; add favorites/save to give a reason to come back |
| Too many/too few mood options paralyze or bore users | A/B test mood list size with a simple prototype |
| Audio preview is expected but hard to build well | Start with simple MIDI playback; upgrade later based on feedback |
